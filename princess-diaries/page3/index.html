            <p>The weather turned nice today.The sun came out.</p>

<p>This week we start a course, Linux, and we have our first class today.Now, I have been using this operating system for about four years, and already knew everything the teacher was going to teach.He seemed unhappy but still said yes.</p>

<p>Actually, I was in his class two years ago, aka, my first year in college.I didn’t select this course formally, but was just interested.Linux is interesting but his class was really boring.Today I even found that he uses the same ppt as two years ago!Jesus, now we already have windows 10 and he was still talking about windows XP and 7!</p>

<p>What’s more, our textbook has already been in use for 10 years, I think.Because a lot of awesome IDE software has come and gone, we are still learning VC.Compared to that, the out-of-date ppt was not a big deal.</p>

<p>Anyway, in my opinion, most teachers in campus have no experience about development. If you are really interested in something, just go to the library and pick a book.You are on your way.</p>

            <p>The rain has stopped today, the weather turns cold and still I can’t see the sun.</p>

<p>November 2nd  was the 200th anniversary of the birth of George Boole, the man who influenced the boolean variables which are almost used in every computer language today.On November 2nd 2015, Google changed its logo in memory of him.Today I read a blog about him, and found that most of his knowledge was achieved through self-learning!</p>

<p>Now I am going to get some sleep, tomorrow is going to be a busy day.</p>

            <p>Shanghai was rainy today. It seems often rains after summer, what bad weather. :(</p>

<p>There is an engineer named David who came to our university to make a lecture about oracle databases. It really tought me something.</p>

<p>I went to a movie with my friends in the evening. It’s a Marvel movie, named Ant Man. I have seen many Marvel movies, such as Captain American, Iron Man,spider man and so on,No,not just Marvel,I also have seen Bat Man,Super Man,etc.Any way, I love super heros.</p>

<p>After the movie, when I came back home, I heard that Sky, who was the most famous Chinese War Craft 3 player, just came to our campus and given a speech.</p>

<p>I just missed it, kind of a pity.</p>

<p>It’s 8 o’clock pm in Shanghai, I should do my homework and get some sleep.</p>

<p>To those who give me corrections: Thank you very much and have a good day~</p>
