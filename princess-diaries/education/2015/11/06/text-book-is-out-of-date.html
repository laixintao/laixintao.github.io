      <p>The weather turned nice today.The sun came out.</p>

<p>This week we start a course, Linux, and we have our first class today.Now, I have been using this operating system for about four years, and already knew everything the teacher was going to teach.He seemed unhappy but still said yes.</p>

<p>Actually, I was in his class two years ago, aka, my first year in college.I didn’t select this course formally, but was just interested.Linux is interesting but his class was really boring.Today I even found that he uses the same ppt as two years ago!Jesus, now we already have windows 10 and he was still talking about windows XP and 7!</p>

<p>What’s more, our textbook has already been in use for 10 years, I think.Because a lot of awesome IDE software has come and gone, we are still learning VC.Compared to that, the out-of-date ppt was not a big deal.</p>

<p>Anyway, in my opinion, most teachers in campus have no experience about development. If you are really interested in something, just go to the library and pick a book.You are on your way.</p>
