            <p>Today I met my tutor.He said he had bought two TVs for showing daily notice.They were very expensive, so he asked me if I could program an alarm system for them.He wants an alarm to go off if someone touches the TV.I thought it would be easy if I made it with raspberry Pi, so I said “yes.”</p>

<p>I ordered two buzzers when I got back home. I had an awesome idea! What if the alarm could send an email with a photo when anyone touches the TV? I decided to make the alarm program with raspberry Pi, using python programming language. The code was easy for me to write and within 2 hours, I finished the project.</p>

<p>Programming is amazing!</p>

            <p>Shanghai’s weather was so damn bad.It was rainy AGAIN!</p>

<p>Today I have watched a movie named NO Half Measures.It’s a documentary about creating the final season of Breaking Bad(I really love this series).</p>

<p>In the afternoon I did nothing but write code.There was a bug that took me almost 3 hours to fix.</p>

<p>In the evening, I played table tennis with a friend from Pakistan.After that, he told me that they had taken part in a competition on Culture Festival in our university, and they should go to collect the votes from passerby. I decided to help him.It’s super easy.It was kind of weird to speak English to my native schoolmates(Because I am with my international friends).</p>

<p>When we stopped collecting, Pakistan was still in the first place, and had 600 more votes than the second. I hope they win.</p>
