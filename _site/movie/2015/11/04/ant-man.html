    <p>Shanghai was rainy today. It seems often rains after summer, what bad weather. :(</p>

<p>There is an engineer named David who came to our university to make a lecture about oracle databases. It really tought me something.</p>

<p>I went to a movie with my friends in the evening. It’s a Marvel movie, named Ant Man. I have seen many Marvel movies, such as Captain American, Iron Man,spider man and so on,No,not just Marvel,I also have seen Bat Man,Super Man,etc.Any way, I love super heros.</p>

<p>After the movie, when I came back home, I heard that Sky, who was the most famous Chinese War Craft 3 player, just came to our campus and given a speech.</p>

<p>I just missed it, kind of a pity.</p>

<p>It’s 8 o’clock pm in Shanghai, I should do my homework and get some sleep.</p>

<p>To those who give me corrections: Thank you very much and have a good day~</p>
